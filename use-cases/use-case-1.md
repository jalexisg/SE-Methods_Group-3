# USE CASE: 1 Database Connection Setup

## CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION

### Goal in Context

As a *System Administrator* I want *the system to connect to the World Database* so that *population data can be accessed reliably.*

### Scope

Application runtime environment and database connectivity.

### Level

Primary task / configuration.

### Preconditions

- Database server is available (hostname/IP, port).
- Credentials are valid and configurable (environment variables, config file or secrets manager).
- Connection handles retries and errors gracefully (retries/backoff configured).
- System works in both local and Docker environments (containerized config supported).

### Success End Condition

The application establishes a successful connection to the World database and can execute a simple verification query.

### Failed End Condition

Connection cannot be established (incorrect credentials, network or DB server down) and the application logs the error and notifies the operator.

### Primary Actor

Developer / DevOps engineer.

### Trigger

Deployment or start of the application, or a manual connectivity test request.

## MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO

1. Operator provides database connection parameters (host, port, user, password, database name) via configuration or environment.
2. System attempts to open a connection using provided parameters.
3. System runs a lightweight verification query (e.g., SELECT 1 or a simple lookup on `country` table) to confirm connectivity and basic query capability.
4. System reports success (logs and health-check endpoint) and proceeds with normal operation.

## EXTENSIONS

2a. **Invalid credentials**:
   1. System logs authentication failure and presents a clear error to the operator.

2b. **Network unreachable or DB server down**:
   1. System logs connection timeout/error, retries according to configured backoff policy, and alerts operator if retries fail.

3a. **Verification query fails**:
   1. System logs detailed error and marks health-check as failing.

## SUB-VARIATIONS

- Use of environment variables when running in containers (Docker / Kubernetes).
- Use of secrets manager (Vault/Secret Manager) to retrieve DB credentials instead of storing in plaintext.

## SCHEDULE

**DUE DATE**: Release 0.1.0
