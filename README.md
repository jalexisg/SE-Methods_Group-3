## Project Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive Population Information System to provide easy access to population data for organizational decision-making and reporting requirements. The system generates 32 specific reports covering countries, cities, capital cities, population summaries, and language demographics.

### Database
The project uses the **World Database**, a comprehensive dataset containing:
- **239 countries** with population, area, government, and economic data
- **4,079 cities** with population statistics worldwide
- **Language information** for demographic analysis
- **Geographic and political data** for comprehensive reporting

This database serves as the primary data source for all population queries and reporting functionality.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or later
- Apache Maven 3.6+
- MySQL Server 8.0+ or Docker MySQL
- Docker (for containerization)
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jalexisg/SE-Methods_Group-3.git
   cd SE-Methods_Group-3
   ```

2. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Copy the world database files to the database directory
   cp /Users/Alexis/Downloads/world-db/* ./database/
   
   # Start MySQL server (if using Docker)
   docker run --name mysql-world -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=example -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:8.0
   
   # Import the world database
   mysql -h localhost -P 3306 -u root -p < database/world.sql
   ```

3. **Compile the project**
   ```bash
   mvn compile
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.napier.sem.Main"
   ```

5. **Build and run with Docker**
   ```bash
   # First compile the Java code
   mvn compile
   
   # Build Docker image
   docker build -t devopsimage .
   
   # Run the container
   docker run --name devopscontainer -d devopsimage
   
   # View the application output
   docker logs devopscontainer
   ```

## Usage

The Population Information System generates comprehensive reports about global population data. Currently implemented reports include:

### **Running the Application:**

#### **With Docker (Recommended):**
```bash
# Start MySQL database
docker run --name mysql-world -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=example -e MYSQL_DATABASE=world -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:8.0

# Import World Database
docker exec -i mysql-world mysql -u root -pexample world < database/world.sql

# Build and run the application
docker build -t devopsimage .
docker run --network host --name devopscontainer devopsimage

# View generated reports
docker logs devopscontainer

# Cleanup
docker rm devopscontainer
```

#### **Local Development:**
```bash
# Compile the application
mvn clean package

# Run directly (requires local MySQL)
java -jar target/population-system-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
