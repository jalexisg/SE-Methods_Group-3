## Project Overview

The **Population Information System** is a Java-based application designed to provide comprehensive population reports using the MySQL World Database. This system connects to a database containing information about 239 countries and 4,079 cities worldwide, generating detailed population analysis reports.

### Key Features
- **Database Integration:** Connects to MySQL World Database with 239 countries and 4,079 cities
- **Population Reports:** Generates 32 different types of population reports
- **Containerized Deployment:** Docker support for easy deployment and scaling
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and deployment through GitHub Actions
- **Professional Output:** Formatted console output with proper alignment and styling

### Current Implementation Status
- âœ… **2/32 Reports Implemented** (6.25% complete)
  - Countries by population (globally)
  - Countries by population (by continent)
- âœ… **Database connectivity established**
- âœ… **Docker containerization completed**
- âœ… **CI/CD pipeline configured**
- ðŸ”„ **30 additional reports pending implementation**

## Technology Stack

**Backend:** Java 17 with Eclipse Temurin JDK  
**Database:** MySQL World Database (239 countries, 4,079 cities)  
**Build Tool:** Apache Maven 3.9+  
**Containerization:** Docker with multi-stage builds  
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions with automated testing  
**Dependencies:** MySQL Connector/J 8.1.0, JUnit 5.10.0

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or later
- Apache Maven 3.6+
- Docker & Docker Compose (for full database functionality)
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jalexisg/SE-Methods_Group-3.git
   cd SE-Methods_Group-3
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```

3. **Run with Docker Compose (Recommended - Shows Real Reports)**
   ```bash
   # Start MySQL database and application
   docker-compose up --build
   
   # Alternative: MySQL only, then run app from host
   docker-compose up mysql -d
   sleep 60  # Wait for database to load
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.napier.sem.Main" -Dexec.args="localhost"
   ```

4. **Run without database (Demo Mode)**
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.napier.sem.Main"
   ```

5. **Create executable JAR**
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   java -jar target/population-info-system-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
   ```

## Usage

The Population Information System generates 32 different types of population reports using the MySQL World Database. **Currently implemented and working:**

### âœ… Available Reports (2/32 implemented - FULLY FUNCTIONAL)

1. **All Countries by Population (Global)**
   - Displays all 239 countries ordered by population from largest to smallest
   - Format: Code, Name, Continent, Region, Population, Capital

2. **Countries by Population (By Continent)**
   - Displays countries in each continent ordered by population
   - Covers: Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Oceania
   - Format: Code, Name, Continent, Region, Population, Capital

### ðŸŽ¯ Running the Application with Full Database

```bash
# Option 1: Full Docker Compose (Complete Setup)
docker-compose up --build

# Option 2: MySQL + Host Application (Recommended for Development)
docker-compose up mysql -d
sleep 60  # Wait for database initialization
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.napier.sem.Main" -Dexec.args="localhost"
```

## Testing

The project uses Maven for build management and includes:

- **Build Verification:** Automated compilation through GitHub Actions
- **Container Testing:** Docker image building and execution verification through CI/CD
- **Continuous Integration:** Automated testing on every push to repository
- **Docker Integration:** Container builds and runs automatically in the pipeline

### Running Tests Locally:
```bash
mvn test  # (Once test cases are implemented)
```

### Testing Docker Container:
```bash
# Build and test the container locally
mvn clean compile
docker build -t population-info-system:test .
docker run --name test-container population-info-system:test
docker logs test-container
docker rm test-container
```

*Comprehensive testing documentation will be added as the test suite develops.*
